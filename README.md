# **Georgia Household Income Analysis**
## **Project Overview**

In America, there are many households that are living above the Federal Poverty level but still unable to afford basic essentials. They are referred to as ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed). ALICE could be a friend or relative, the neighbor down the street, or the barista that is making your coffee. There are six essential elements that are part of the budget for households:

1. Housing
    * The most expensive part of the budget but the main element in stability.
2. Child Care and Education
    * The second most expensive part of the budget. Without this, children are at risk of health and safety risks. It's also a way for students to advance to sustainable jobs and escape the cycle.
3. Food
    * One of the most basic needs that correlates with school or work performance and chronic disease. ALICE families encounter difficulties in getting access to healthy foods and food security.
4. Transportation
    * Transportation is important to get to school, work, or grocery stores. In America, a car is almost necessary to get around.
5. Health Care
    * While healthcare is more accessible to families now, there are still many without insurance. There are also many more that cannot access quality, regular healthcare.
6. Technology
    * The world is becoming more digitized and it has become an essential part of the economy.

These elements are interconnected and households are forced to make difficult choices such as deciding whether to pay the car payments or rent.

This project aims to understand how the state of the economy and policies affect households in Georgia by answering the following questions:

1. Are households going into ALICE income levels over the years or is it getting better? 
2. How many households are in the ALICE income level?
3. How did covid affect households in Georgia?

## **Dataset**

The data that I have used is from the open dataset sourced from [ALICE Open Dataset](https://www.unitedforalice.org/state-overview/Georgia), specifically for the state of Georgia.

The dataset contains the following data from 2010 through 2021: year, counties, number of households, households in poverty, ALICE households, households above ALICE, households under or over the age of 65, and length of survey.
